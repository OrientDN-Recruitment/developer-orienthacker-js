Guidelines
-----
These brief guidelines will help you quick start on our missions

### Setup guide
You will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 12+ to start on your missions.

Here are steps for getting started:

1. Clone / fork this repository
2. Install dependencies using command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Pick your mission (episode) and discuss with your interviewer to clear requirements
4. Start coding, run a command to watch your results, for example with Episode 1:
    ```
    npm run episode_1
    ```
### Fix package version conflicts

What if locked versions of dependencies conflict with your NodeJS version? You can simply remove it in `package.json` and re-add the conflicted dependencies.

### How can I get the best result?

Here is some things to ensure your victory:

1. Keep calm and be confident
2. Discuss with your interviewer to clear requirements and select best way to complete your missions before start coding
3. Concise doesn't mean simple. Make sure to fulfill all requirements. 
4. Don't be too of a perfectionist, killing your time over optimizing little things in your code.
