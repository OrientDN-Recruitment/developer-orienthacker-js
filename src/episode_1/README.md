Episode 1: The Alpha
-----
This is your first day at Vilian, the manager hands down a requirement to build an API for company's internal tool. This API is used for adding company staffs.

> Coding time: 10-20min

### Requirements
+ Write a new JSON API in `index.js` to add company staffs along with their personal information, which are:
  - `email`
  - `full_name`
  - `address`
  - `phone_number` (vietnam numbers only)
+ We prepared a robust validation library [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/) for you. If you're not quite familiar with it, you may consider leveraging other approaches.

### What success looks like
- API should pass all tests
- API should have complete validations on all of its fields
- API should follow a standard response format, and HTTP codes
- API code should be clean and easy for reuse

### Goals and non-goals
- This is a test for robust development, the more concise the code is, the better.
- All requirements should be fulfilled, nothing more. You can discuss with the interviewer beforehand about the best approach you can take.
